    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>for <strong>Medical Assistant (HOPI)</strong> by <strong>Innovators Generation</strong></p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p><em>Last updated: <time datetime="2025-08-14">August 14, 2025</time></em></p>

    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Innovators Generation</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects,
      uses, and protects information when you use our mobile application
      <strong>Medical Assistant (HOPI)</strong> (package name: <code>com.newgen.medical_assistant_hopi</code>) (“the App”).
    </p>

    <h2>What the App does</h2>
    <p>
      Medical Assistant (HOPI) helps medical students and clinicians draft and organize medical
      notes (including history writing) and related documentation. Optional speech-to-text features
      allow you to dictate notes using the device microphone.
    </p>

    <h2>Permissions & data categories</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Microphone (<code>RECORD_AUDIO</code>)</strong>: Used <em>only</em> to capture your speech for voice dictation and convert it to text. Audio is processed solely for dictation and not used for other purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>User-Provided Content</strong>: Text you enter or dictate (e.g., drafts, prompts, templates) remains under your control.</li>
      <li><strong>Device & App Diagnostics</strong>: Non-identifying data (e.g., device model, OS version, app version, crash logs) to improve reliability and performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide core features (note drafting, history writing, dictation, templates).</li>
      <li>Improve accuracy, performance, and the user experience.</li>
      <li>Respond to support requests and prevent abuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Processing & storage</h2>
    <p>
      The App processes your inputs to generate text for you within the App. Depending on features
      you enable, certain processing (e.g., speech-to-text or AI suggestions) may be performed by
      trusted platform services or third-party providers you choose (see below). We do not sell your personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-party services</h2>
    <p>
      To deliver specific features, the App may use services such as Android/iOS speech APIs or other
      providers you explicitly enable. Such services process only what is necessary to provide the selected
      feature and are governed by their respective privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Sensitive information</h2>
    <p>
      The App is a documentation aid and does not provide medical advice. You are responsible for ensuring
      your content complies with applicable laws, institutional policies, and confidentiality requirements.
      Do not include personally identifiable patient information unless lawfully authorized and appropriately safeguarded.
    </p>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>On-device content</strong>: Your notes are stored locally on your device unless you export or sync them using services of your choice. You can delete them at any time from within the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong>: Crash/analytics data, if collected, is retained only as long as necessary to improve the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your choices & rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Microphone access</strong>: Enable/disable in device settings at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>Data access & deletion</strong>: Delete notes locally in the App. You can request deletion of any server-side diagnostics tied to your use by contacting us (see Contact).</li>
      <li><strong>Export</strong>: Export note content using the App’s export options (where available).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Medical Assistant (HOPI) is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from them.
      If you believe a child has provided information, contact us and we will delete it promptly.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information. However, no method of
      transmission or storage is 100% secure. You are responsible for securing any exported files or backups.
    </p>

    <h2>International transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location and the services you enable, information may be processed in jurisdictions with
      different data-protection laws than your own.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Safety on Google Play</h2>
    <p>
      Our <em>Data safety</em> section on Google Play describes how the App collects, shares, and protects data,
      and is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If changes are significant, we will provide notice in the App
      or update the “Last updated” date above.
    </p>
