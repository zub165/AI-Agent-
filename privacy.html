    <h1>Privacy Policy for AI Agent</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 14, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>AI Agent</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app. 
    We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. Our app only collects and uses information necessary for its core functionality.</p>

    <h2>2. Permissions Used</h2>
    <p><strong>Microphone (RECORD_AUDIO)</strong> – This permission allows the app to access your device’s microphone <strong>only</strong> when you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Record audio for app features (e.g., voice commands, audio messages, speech recognition).</li>
        <li>The app does <strong>not</strong> record audio without your action or consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal audio recordings on our servers.</li>
        <li>Any audio captured is processed only for the intended feature and is not stored beyond that session unless you explicitly save it.</li>
        <li>We do not sell or rent your data to third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may use trusted third-party services (e.g., speech recognition APIs) to process audio, but no personally identifiable information is sent without your consent.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You can deny microphone access in your device settings. Doing so will disable features that require audio input.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy. Any changes will be posted on this page with a new "Effective Date."</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
