    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>for <strong>Medical Assistant (HOPI)</strong> by <strong>Newgen</strong></p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p><em>Last updated: <span id="updated">August 14, 2025</span></em></p>

    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Newgen</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects,
      uses, and protects information when you use the mobile application
      <strong>Medical Assistant (HOPI)</strong> (“the App”).
    </p>

    <h2>What the app does</h2>
    <p>
      Medical Assistant (HOPI) helps medical students and clinicians draft and organize medical
      notes (including history writing) and related documentation. Optional speech-to-text
      features allow you to dictate notes using the device microphone.
    </p>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User-Provided Content</strong>: Text you enter or dictate (e.g., medical note drafts, prompts, or templates) within the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Audio for Dictation (Microphone)</strong>: If you use voice dictation, the App accesses the device microphone to capture your speech and convert it to text. Audio is used only for this purpose.</li>
      <li><strong>Device &amp; App Diagnostics</strong>: Non-identifying information such as app version, device model, OS version, crash logs, and basic analytics to improve reliability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide core features (note drafting, history writing, voice dictation, templates).</li>
      <li>Improve accuracy, performance, and user experience.</li>
      <li>Respond to support requests and prevent abuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data processing &amp; storage</h2>
    <p>
      By default, Medical Assistant (HOPI) processes your inputs to generate text output within the
      App. Depending on your settings and features you enable, some processing (e.g., speech-to-text or AI suggestions)
      may be handled by trusted third-party services (see below). We do not sell your personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-party services</h2>
    <p>
      To deliver certain features, the App may interact with platform services (e.g., Android speech APIs)
      or other providers you explicitly enable in settings. These services process only what is needed to
      provide the feature and are subject to their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Sensitive information</h2>
    <p>
      The App is a documentation aid and does not itself provide medical advice. You are responsible for
      ensuring that any content you enter complies with applicable laws, policies, and your organization’s
      confidentiality requirements. Do not include personally identifiable patient information unless you
      have lawful authorization and appropriate safeguards in place.
    </p>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>On-device content</strong>: Your notes are stored on your device unless you export or sync them using services of your choice. You can delete them at any time from within the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong>: Crash/analytics data, if collected, is retained only as long as necessary to improve the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your choices &amp; rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Microphone access</strong>: Grant or revoke in your device settings at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>Data access &amp; deletion</strong>: You can delete your notes locally in the App. You may also request deletion of any server-side diagnostics tied to your use by contacting us (see Contact below).</li>
      <li><strong>Export</strong>: You may export note content using the App’s export features (where available).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Medical Assistant (HOPI) is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from
      children under 13. If you believe a child has provided information, contact us and we will promptly delete it.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information. However, no method of
      transmission or storage is 100% secure. You are responsible for safeguarding any exported files or backups
      you create.
    </p>

    <h2>International transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location and the services you enable, information may be processed in
      jurisdictions that may have different data-protection laws than your own.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If changes are significant, we will provide notice
      in the App or by updating the “Last updated” date above.
    </p>
